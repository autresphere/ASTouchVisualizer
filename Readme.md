## ASTouchVisualizer
ASTouchVisualizer is a simple class that shows the current touch event on top of all your views.

It is used to create iPhone or iPad video tutorials on which finger movement is clearly seen.

It is dead simple to use in a project, no overloading needed. Just copy the file in your project and call the install method.
